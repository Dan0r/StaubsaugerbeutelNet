# StaubsaugerbeutelNet 👝
A web app that, when you input your vacuum cleaner model, outputs a compatible vacuum cleaner bag from the German supermarket chain EDEKA.


# Goals
A project to learn Java, because I love coffee. It will also make me study and practice Object-Oriented Programming and Web Exploitation. And - if all goes well :p - put a website online.
